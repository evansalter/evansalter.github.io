      // Hack to get a SPA working on GH Pages.
      // Without this, SPA works when starting at main page
      // but when you go directly to a URL, say /projects,
      // it 404s.  This will have the URL to session storage,
      // and redirect to the root.  Then index.html will check
      // for this saved URL and redirect to it.
