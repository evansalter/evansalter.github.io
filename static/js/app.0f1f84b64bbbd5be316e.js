I have never been really interested in voice assistants, but having received one for free I thought I might as well check it out. While I never really cared to control the Hue bulbs and smart outlets I have scattered throughout my apartment, I quickly realized multi-room audio would be the biggest advantage of these devices for me. Rather than spending a ton of money on something like Sonos, I can very cheaply set up a whole-home audio system. While the audio quality on these little devices will never be as good as Sonos, I find it adequate (especially for the price). Plus, in my main listening area, my living room, I have a home theater sound system that I can tie into. That should be easy enough, right?</p>\n<h4>The Problem</h4>\n<p>Amazon supports two ways to connect an Echo to an external speaker system:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Via bluetooth</li>\n<li>Via an aux cable</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The obvious choice to connect to a home theater receiver would be via aux. It offers the best quality with no latency or fiddling with wireless connections. The major downside of this is that ALL of the Echo\'s audio will be routed through the line out port. You cannot, for example, configure music to route to the aux while voice responses come through the internal speaker. You also can\'t disable and enable the output using your voice. As long as something is plugged in, the internal speaker is fully disabled. This is a <strong>huge</strong> problem for a home theater system. If I plug the Echo into it using an aux cable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have to leave the receiver on at all times</li>\n<li>I cannot use Alexa while watching TV or listening to music on another source</li>\n<li>I have to always turn the receiver back to the Echo input when I\'m done watching TV</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This set up would make the whole system much more complicated and unintuitive, which is a huge turn-off for me.</p>\n<p>A bluetooth connection on the Echo is a little bit better. While you cannot choose which audio to route through which output, you <em>can</em> use your voice to connect and disconnect to the speaker. That way, you are in control of where the sound is output to. However, it still requires a manual step. Further, my receiver does not have built-in bluetooth.</p>\n<p>With the smart devices I have in my home, it would be great if I could control the output of the Echo in an easy and automated way.</p>\n<h4>The Solution</h4>\n<p>The solution I have settled on is somewhat convoluted, but works very well. It involves the following parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Some sort of stereo system (a home theater receiver in my case)</li>\n<li>A smart outlet (I\'m using a TP-Link model)</li>\n<li>A Harmony Hub and Remote</li>\n<li><a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a></li>\n<li>A bluetooth receiver that runs <strong>only</strong> on wall power (not battery-powered or rechargable)</li>\n<li>An Amazon Echo</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The main idea is that the bluetooth receiver is powered via the smart outlet. In turn, the outlet is controlled by the Harmony Hub. By setting up the Harmony to only turn on the bluetooth outlet when the receiver is on the proper source, this allows us to easily control what device the Echo plays sound through.</p>\n<p>If the receiver is off or I\'m playing something through a different source, I am able to use the Echo as normal. I can also play multi-room audio if I don\'t care about having it run through the stereo system. When I want the Echo to output to the stereo, I simply press a single button on the Harmony remote (or use a voice command) which does the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Turns the receiver on</li>\n<li>Turns the smart outlet on, which turns the bluetooth receiver on\n<ul>\n<li>The Echo automatically connects to this and switches its audio output</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sets the receiver to the proper input</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When I\'m done listening to music on the stereo, I press the &quot;off&quot; button on the remote, everything shuts off, and the Echo switches back to the internal speaker.</p>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>Every component is easy to set up on it\'s own. The problems arise when you try to get everything to talk to each other. This really made me realise what a mess the home automation industry is at the moment. Let\'s break down the pieces of communication that need to happen for this project:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Communication</th>\n<th>Supported?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bluetooth Receiver ↔ Amazon Echo</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amazon Echo ↔ Harmony Hub</td>\n<td>✓</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Harmony Hub ↔ TP-Link Smart Outlet</td>\n<td>✗</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you can see, the Harmony Hub cannot natively control WiFi devices. It requires a hub (like SmartThings) to facilitate these communications.</p>\n<h5>Home Assistant</h5>\n<p>To allow Harmony to control the WiFi outlet I used Home Assistant to emulate a hue bridge. This presents a fake Hue bridge on the network that supports non-Hue devices. The Harmony is able to control this because it just looks like a Hue device.</p>\n<p>To get started you\'ll need to run Home Assistant on a computer in your home. There are a ton of guides out there for different systems so I\'m not going to go into depth. I have mine running on a Raspberry Pi using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/raspberrypi3-homeassistant/"><code>homeassistant/raspberrypi3-homeassistant</code></a> Docker image.</p>\n<p>It\'s a really good idea to give both the computer that is running Home Assistant, and the devices you are connecting to, a static IP address. Otherwise, your Home Assistant configuration can break when your router assigns a new IP to your devices.</p>\n<p>Configurating Home Assistant is done mainly through <code>yaml</code> configuration files. There are a few types of devices, such as Philips Hue, that can automatically be discovered and configured, but the rest is done through via yaml. Find the configuration file for your version of Home Assistant (usually called <code>configuration.yaml</code>) and add the following:</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-attr">switch:</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  - platform:</span> <span class="hljs-string">tplink</span>    <span class="hljs-comment"># if you have a different brand, you will need to find the proper platform ID</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">    host:</span> <span class="hljs-number">172.16</span><span class="hljs-number">.1</span><span class="hljs-number">.102</span>  <span class="hljs-comment"># the static IP address of the outlet</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">    name:</span> <span class="hljs-string">bluetooth_outlet</span>\n</div></pre>\n<p>After reloading your configuration, you should be able to control the outlet via the Home Assistant UI.</p>\n<p>Next, we need to create a Hue Bridge to expose to Harmony. Again, edit the configuration with the following:</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-attr">emulated_hue:</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">    expose_by_default:</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">    entities:</span>\n        <span class="hljs-string">switch.bluetooth_outlet:</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">            name:</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Bluetooth Outlet"</span>\n</div></pre>\n<p>And that should do it! All this section does is turn on the emulated bridge and expose a single entity through it.</p>\n<h5>Harmony Hub Setup</h5>\n<p>To set up your Harmony Hub to work with the emulated Hue bridge, do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open your Harmony app</li>\n<li>Tap the menu icon, then &quot;Harmony Setup&quot;</li>\n<li>Choose &quot;Add/Edit Devices &amp; Activities&quot;</li>\n<li>Choose &quot;Devices&quot;</li>\n<li>If you currently have a Hue bridge connected to your Harmony, you must delete it\n<ul>\n<li>If you have lights you still want to control using your Harmony remote, take a look at the <a href="#using-hue-lights-with-harmony">Using Hue Lights with Harmony</a> section before proceeding</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Unplug any physical Hue bridges you may have</li>\n<li>Click &quot;Add Device&quot;, then choose &quot;Philips Hue&quot; under &quot;Home Control&quot;</li>\n<li>When you get to the step that tells you to press the center button, wait for a couple minutes. Home Assitant should automatically send the command to register it</li>\n<li>Complete the setup</li>\n<li>Plug your physical Hue bridges back in</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You should now be able to set up activities and home control buttons to use your smart outlet, just like this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Activity</th>\n<th>Home Control Button</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src="'+s(180)+'" alt=""></td>\n<td><img src="'+s(181)+'" alt=""></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><a name="using-hue-lights-with-harmony"></a></p>\n<h5>Using Hue Lights with Harmony</h5>\n<p>The one remaining issue with this solution is the ability to control your Hue lights with the Harmony, since we removed the physical bridge from the Harmony\'s configuration. Harmony can, unfortunately, only connect to one Hue bridge at the time, so we will have to find a way to expose the lights through the emulated bridge.</p>\n<p>My home has Hue lights in the Living Room and Bedroom. I only care about controling the Living Room lights with the Harmony because that\'s the room the remote is in. To add the lights to the emulated bridge, we need to connect the physical bridge to Home Assistant. Hue Bridges can be added automatically using the UI:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the UI in a web browser (usually port 8123 of the device it\'s running on)</li>\n<li>Click &quot;Configuration&quot; &gt; &quot;Integrations&quot;</li>\n<li>Under &quot;Set up a new integration&quot;, choose &quot;Configure&quot; next to &quot;Philips Hue&quot;</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To expose your lights on the emulated bridge, add them to the <code>emulated_hue.entities</code> section of your yaml file:</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-attr">emulated_hue:</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">    expose_by_default:</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">    entities:</span>\n        <span class="hljs-string">light.living_room:</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">            name:</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Living Room Light"</span>\n        <span class="hljs-string">switch.bluetooth_outlet:</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">            name:</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Bluetooth Outlet"</span>\n</div></pre>\n<p>These entities should now be available for use in your Harmony app!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I hope this was a helpful guide to integrating your Amazon Echo with your stereo or home theater sound system.

They make it extremely easy to build feature-rich, highly performant web applications.  So you go ahead and build yourself a SPA, but one question remains.  Where do you host it?</p>\n<p>This article is separated into two parts.  First, an outline of the different SPA hosting methods I have used, along with their pros and cons.  Second, my experience with hosting an SPA on GitHub Pages, including any trouble I have had.  I hope to help the readers make an informed decision regarding where to host their app, and if they do choose to use any of the methods I talk about, learn from my mistakes.</p>\n<p>If you wish to focus on GitHub Pages, and skip the other methods, you can jump to section 4: GitHub Pages.</p>\n<h4>1. Google App Engine</h4>\n<p>I didn\'t really get into web development until I started my current job.  Yes, I knew some HTML and CSS, and I had taken a university web dev class.  However, I wasn\'t all that interested until I started using those skills in the workplace.</p>\n<p>At my job, all of our core applications are built using App Engine.  We use the Python version, with Jinja2 as our templating language, and Knockout.js for frontend code.  After a while I began to feel very comfortable developing in App Engine.  It was familiar, and I had gotten to the point where I could throw together a new application relatively quickly and easily.</p>\n<p>Now, back to SPAs.  In the summer of 2016, I started working on <a href="https://www.rolluptracker.com/">Roll Up Tracker</a>.  Roll Up Tracker is an Angular2 web-app that allows you to track your wins and losses during the Roll Up The Rim To Win season at Tim Hortons.  Naturally, when I started the project I decided to host it on App Engine.  It might seem a bit odd to have to bootstrap an entire App Engine project just to serve some HTML and Javascript.  However, I justify it by the fact that the backend was written in Python, using Google Cloud Datastore as the database.  It made sense to keep the frontend hosted alongside that.</p>\n<p>The implementation was pretty straightforward.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add a couple rules for the frontend files, and a backend catch-all to your <code>app.yaml</code></li>\n<li>Create a wildcard route to a handler that just serves <code>index.html</code></li>\n<li>Create your API routes above your wildcard so they get matched first</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-comment"># app.yaml</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">- url:</span> <span class="hljs-string">/assets/(.*)</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  static_files:</span> <span class="hljs-string">dist/assets/\\1</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  upload:</span> <span class="hljs-string">dist/assets/.*</span>\n\n<span class="hljs-attr">- url:</span> <span class="hljs-string">/(.*\\.(js|map))$</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  static_files:</span> <span class="hljs-string">dist/\\1</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  upload:</span> <span class="hljs-string">dist/(.*\\.(js|map))</span>\n\n<span class="hljs-attr">- url:</span> <span class="hljs-string">.*</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  script:</span> <span class="hljs-string">main.app</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  secure:</span> <span class="hljs-string">always</span>\n</div></pre>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">MainHandler</span><span class="hljs-params">(BaseHandler)</span>:</span>\n\n    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">get</span><span class="hljs-params">(self, *args, **kwargs)</span>:</span>\n        context = {}\n        self.response.write(template.render(os.path.join(TEMPLATE_DIR, <span class="hljs-string">\'index.html\'</span>), context))\n</div></pre>\n<p>That\'s about it!  Moving on to method number two...</p>\n<h4>2. Google App Engine Flex</h4>\n<p>Oooooh &quot;App Engine Flex&quot;!  Sounds new and shiny and perfect and awesome.  It was, at first.</p>\n<p>I had built a very small SPA using Vue.js called <a href="https://scrobblin-friends.appspot.com/">Scrobblin\' With Friends</a> as an attempt to bring Last.fm back into my life.  It\'s a simple app that allows you to enter your Last.fm username, and it shows you what all your friends are listening to.  It\'s a tiny app, with absolutely zero backend.  All it does is take in a username, hit an API every ~10 seconds, and display some data.  It definitely didn\'t make sense to bootstrap an App Engine project.</p>\n<p>Then I discovered Flex, and found out they have a Node.js environment.  It was extremely easy to set up:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>app.yaml</code> with 2 lines:  <code>runtime: nodejs</code> and <code>env: flex</code></li>\n<li><code>package.json</code> with a <code>start</code> script</li>\n<li>A simple express server</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-comment">// server.js</span>\n<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> express = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">\'express\'</span>);\n<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> app = express();\n\n<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> PORT = process.env.PORT || <span class="hljs-number">8080</span>;\n\napp.get(<span class="hljs-string">\'/static/*\'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">request, response</span>)</span>{\n     <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">\'static file request : \'</span> + request.params[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]);\n     response.sendFile( __dirname + <span class="hljs-string">\'/static/\'</span> + request.params[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]);\n});\n\napp.get(<span class="hljs-string">\'*\'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">request, response</span>) </span>{\n    response.sendFile(__dirname + <span class="hljs-string">\'/index.html\'</span>);\n});\n\napp.listen(PORT);\n</div></pre>\n<p>I finished the setup very quickly, deployed it, and life was good.  That is, until I got my bill for the month.</p>\n<p>One of the big differences you notice between the Standard App Engine environment, and the Flex environment, is that your project never completely spins down.  On Standard, if nobody is hitting your site, you don\'t pay.  Even if you\'re getting a little bit of traffic, they\'re quite generous with the free tier.  Unbeknownst to me, &quot;free tier&quot; isn\'t a thing on Flex.  I racked up about $30 in a couple days before I noticed.</p>\n<p>I could see Flex being a viable option if you have a project you were willing to pay big bucks to host.  This was not one of those projects.  So back to App Engine Standard I went.</p>\n<h4>3. now</h4>\n<p>If you haven\'t heard of <a href="https://zeit.co/now">now</a>, go check it out now (heh).  It is seriously cool.  After installing it on your computer, just type <code>now</code> on your command line, and next thing you know, your application is on the web.</p>\n<p>The only requirement is that you have a <code>package.json</code> with a <code>start</code> script.  <code>now</code> takes care of the rest.</p>\n<p>As cool as the deployment process is, there were some things I didn\'t like about it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The free tier gives you these janky URLs for your project, for example: coolproject-glkqdjsslm.now.sh.  I usually don\'t mind having strange URLs when I\'m not paying for hosting, but the issue is that every time you deploy, you get a new URL.  You basically can\'t host anything that other people are going to use for free</li>\n<li>Their cheapest paid tier, which gets you 1000 deploys/month (instead of 20), private codebases, and more is $14.99/mo.  Much more than I was willing to pay for silly side projects.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>4. GitHub Pages</h4>\n<p>Finally.  You sat through the excruciating minutia of my SPA hosting experiences.  We have finally arrived at the point of the article, which is to outline my experiences hosting an SPA on GitHub Pages.</p>\n<p>It seems like the logical place to serve a SPA from, right?  You\'ve got free hosting.  Deploys are a breeze.  Free SSL.  Plus your code is probably going to be kept on GitHub anyway!</p>\n<p>I had recently decided that it was time to replace my personal website, which was previously a free Wordpress site that I put zero effort into (and I eventually password protected it because I was embarrassed by it).  My new site, which you are currently looking at, is written in Vue.js with no backend, so I could really choose any provider I wanted.  App Engine (both Standard and Flex) were overkill and/or too expensive, <code>now</code> was also unfeasible because of the reasons I stated above.  So here we are.  GitHub Pages is the chosen one.</p>\n<p>It is not without it\'s faults.  Of course, there are a few quirks here and there that you might need to work around, but I haven\'t come across any blockers, and I\'m sure you wouldn\'t either.  That said, if GitHub Pages were a paid service, some of the problems I encountered would have made me throw in the towel and switch to something else.  Since it\'s free, I was willing to put in the time to work around the issues.</p>\n<p>I\'d like to walk through how the whole thing works, including any &quot;gotchas&quot; that I encountered along the way.</p>\n<h3>Part 1: What is GitHub Pages?</h3>\n<p>First off, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">go here</a>.  It has all the basics of Pages, and if you want more detailed documentation you can click &quot;Pages Help&quot; in the top-right corner.</p>\n<p>There are two types of Pages.  The first is an Organization/Personal page.  This lives in a repo called <code>&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;.github.io</code>, has a URL that matches the repo name, and is meant to be a general landing page for a person or organization (duh).  The code for the site lives in this project.</p>\n<p>The other kind, a Project page, most commonly lives in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, or in a <code>/docs</code> folder on <code>master</code>.  Then, you access the page from <code>&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;.github.io/&lt;PROJECT_NAME&gt;</code>.  It allows you to keep all the code in one place.  Pretty handy, I think.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this post, I will be talking about Personal pages.</p>\n<h3>Part 2: What should my repo look like?</h3>\n<p>This was the first problem I came across.  A personal site is served from the <code>master</code> branch.  That meant I couldn\'t just create a project using the Vue CLI, commit everything to master, and expect it to work.</p>\n<p>After doing some research online, I settled on a plan.  I created a <code>sources</code> branch that houses the source files.  Then, on my computer, I built the project, initialized the generated <code>dist</code> directory as a git repo, set it to track <code>master</code>, then committed and pushed.  It worked pretty well, but it was largely manual.  Plus if I ever re-cloned the project or used another computer, I\'d have to set up the dist repo again.  Annoying.</p>\n<h3>Part 3: Automating Deployments</h3>\n<p>I was not about to settle for the process laid out above, so I figured I could devise a script that could do that for me, then just set up Travis CI to run it.  There are quite a few scripts floating around the internet that do exactly that.  I played with one for a while, tweaking it to work for my project, when I found out that Travis actually has a GitHub Pages deployment provider.  A couple commits later, I ended up with a pretty simple <code>.travis.yml</code> that took care of everything for me.</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-attr">language:</span> <span class="hljs-string">node_js</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">node_js:</span>\n<span class="hljs-bullet">  -</span> <span class="hljs-string">"node"</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">script:</span>\n<span class="hljs-bullet">  -</span> <span class="hljs-string">yarn</span> <span class="hljs-string">run</span> <span class="hljs-string">lint</span>\n<span class="hljs-bullet">  -</span> <span class="hljs-string">yarn</span> <span class="hljs-string">run</span> <span class="hljs-string">build</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">deploy:</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  provider:</span> <span class="hljs-string">pages</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  skip_cleanup:</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  github_token:</span> <span class="hljs-string">$GITHUB_TOKEN</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  local_dir:</span> <span class="hljs-string">dist</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  target_branch:</span> <span class="hljs-string">master</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">  on:</span>\n<span class="hljs-attr">    branch:</span> <span class="hljs-string">sources</span>\n</div></pre>\n<p>It basically just runs my lint and build, then if the branch is <code>sources</code>, force-push the <code>dist</code> directory to <code>master</code>.  For more info on this, check out the <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/">Travis CI docs</a>.</p>\n<h3>Part 4: Routing</h3>\n<p>It was very smooth sailing for a while.  I was developing locally very quickly using the webpack dev server, complete with hot module reloading.  When I wanted to deploy, I just pushed up my changes and in a minute or so they were live.  I had no problems setting up the Vue router at all.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, when I was using the live site I was always starting from the root of the site.  I never tried to go directly to <code>/projects</code> or any other page.  That\'s when I hit a snag.  Trying to go directly to a route in my app resulted in a 404 page.</p>\n<p>I definitely wasn\'t shocked when I discovered this.  It makes total sense, since GitHub doesn\'t know about the Vue app\'s routes.  All it knows is there is an <code>index.html</code> file in the repo that it can route to.</p>\n<p>I attempted two different solutions to this problem.  Depending on your requirements, one may be more appropriate than the other.</p>\n<h4>Attempt 1: Hacking the 404 page.</h4>\n<p>I found another person online that was trying to solve the same problem as me.  You can see his blog post <a href="http://www.backalleycoder.com/2016/05/13/sghpa-the-single-page-app-hack-for-github-pages/">here</a>.  I\'ll admit it\'s quite a janky solution to the problem but it was also simple to implement.  Until GitHub comes up with a better solution, this is a pretty decent workaround.</p>\n<p>This solution is based on the fact that you can use a custom 404 page on GH Pages.  All you have to do is add a <code>404.html</code> page to your repo.  Following the link above, I created <code>404.html</code> with the following lines in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>:</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="undefined">\n  sessionStorage.redirect = location.href;\n</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>\n<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">meta</span> <span class="hljs-attr">http-equiv</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"refresh"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">content</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"0;URL=\'/\'"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">meta</span>&gt;</span>\n</div></pre>\n<p>Basically all this does is save the requested URL in your browser\'s storage, and boot you back to the root of the site.  Obviously, that\'s not enough.  If someone click a link to this blog post, I wouldn\'t want them being sent to the homepage.  The next step was just as simple.  I basically added another script to <code>index.html</code> to check for that saved URL, and redirect to it if it exists.</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="actionscript">\n  (<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>{\n    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> redirect = sessionStorage.redirect;\n    <span class="hljs-keyword">delete</span> sessionStorage.redirect;\n    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (redirect &amp;&amp; redirect != location.href) {\n      history.replaceState(<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>, redirect);\n    }\n  })();\n</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>\n</div></pre>\n<p>This worked surprisingly well.  However, once I decided to implement Open Graph and Twitter meta tags in my blog posts, it fell apart due to the scrapers not following the redirects.  However, if you have a simple site that doesn\'t require meta tags, then this just might work for you.</p>\n<h4>Attempt 2: Pre-rendering a Static Site</h4>\n<p>There were two issues with the above router hack in terms of serving meta tags:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When Facebook, Slack, Twitter, or any other site with rich media cards would scan my links, they would land on the 404 page as expected.  However, they would not get redirected to the proper page by the method I shared above.  This is because GitHub Pages returned a 404 status code for the 404 page, which told the scrapers to give up.</li>\n<li>Even if I didn\'t use the 404 page hack, my meta tags were generated on the fly in my Vue app.  Since the scraper downloads the page without executing any javascript, it would not find the meta tags.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, the two obvious solutions are server-side rendering or pre-rending.  I didn\'t want to go down the path of server-side rendering, since I don\'t want to host a server for this website.  So, pre-rendering it is!</p>\n<p>Since I\'m using Webpack, I thought it made sense to add a webpack plugin to generate static HTML from my site.  I found a couple prebuilt plugins to do this, which both leveraged PhantomJS to render the site.  For some reason, I could not get it to render any actual content in my site.  I wasted a ton of time trying to get it working, with no success.</p>\n<p>Frustrated with that, I decided to write my own plugin.  Thus, <a href="https://github.com/evansalter/webpack-static-site-generator">webpack-static-site-generator</a> was born (great name, I know).  With that plugin in place, every time I built my site for production I would get static HTML files for all of my pages.  I could still use the Webpack dev server when developing locally without building, which was a huge plus.</p>\n<p>So, if you have any trouble hosting your SPA on any hosting provider, you might want to check out pre-rendering.</p>\n<h3>Part 5: Custom Domain</h3>\n<p>If you\'ve made it this far, you should be done with the &quot;gotchas&quot; of hosting a single-page app on GH Pages.  Setting up a custom domain was very easy.  There were just a couple steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a file called <code>CNAME</code> in your repo, which contains a single line with the domain you want to use (i.e. <code>www.evansalter.com</code>).  Make sure this file get commited to your master branch when the build runs.</li>\n<li>Set up a <code>CNAME</code> record with your domain registrar that points to your <code>github.io</code> address (i.e. <code>evansalter.github.io</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are some slightly different instructions on GitHub\'s support pages if you want to use an apex domain (no www), but it shouldn\'t be too much work.</p>\n<p>There was one slight problem I discovered.  There is NO SSL support when you\'re using a custom domain with GH Pages.  I was a tad annoyed at this, but seeing as my site has no real reason to be on HTTPS, I got over it.</p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>I very excited about using GitHub Pages to host a single-page app when I first started this site.  However, it wasn\'t quite as magical as it seemed.  I faced many problems along the way.  Some of them had simple solutions, while others were a little more complicated.  However, I\'m still happy with how it worked out in the end.  The simplicity of Pages is what makes it great, and I would recommend that everybody at least considers it for their next project.</p>\n</section>\n'},1076:function(t,e,s){t.exports="<section><p><em>This post is a continuation of <a href=\"/blog/my-0-photo-booth-setup\">My $0 Photo Booth Setup</a>.</em></p>\n<p>After a successful evening with the photo booth, I had over 230 pictures to deal with. The goal was to lightly edit each photo and create collages of each photo booth session. I'd like to share my process here, hopefully providing inspiration or assistance for those looking to do something similar.</p>\n<h3>Editing the Photos</h3>\n<p>I wanted to do a very quick edit of all the photos. I imported them into Capture One, selected all, and ran auto-adjustments. This was good enough for me to continue.</p>\n<p>Next, I wanted to ensure the photos were cropped well. You could see the wall behind the backdrop on the sides, so I wanted to crop that out. Since the camera was on a tripod all night and didn't move, I just cropped the first photo and copied that adjustment to the rest.</p>\n<p>After adjusting the crop of a few photos with particularly tall people, I exported them all to JPEGs.</p>\n<h3>Creating the Collages</h3>\n<p>Now that I had the raw images in pretty good shape, I wanted to create collages or photo strips of each group of 4 photos. I wanted the collages to be styled nicely and have some sort of messaging related to the evening. I also wanted to automate the process, as I wasn't keen on manually making ~60 of these.</p>\n<h4>Step 1: Grouping the Images</h4>\n<p>There were a couple moments in the night when the camera took 3 images instead of 4, or I took a test shot and didn't delete it. Therefore, I didn't have exactly 4 images per session. To fix this, I simply switched to a thumbnail view in Capture One (you could also do this in a file broswer) and adjusted the zoom until there were 4 pictures in each row. This made it simple to quickly scan and find where there were extra pictures. I just deleted the extra ones until the total nmumber of images was divisible by 4.</p>\n<h4>Step 2: Creating the Template</h4>\n<p>I opened up Photoshop CS6 and created a new 4 x 6 document. I imported 4 images from the shoot as smart objects, arranged them, and added a background and some text. This was the final result:</p>\n<p><img src=\""+s(23)+'" alt=""></p>\n<p>I saved this as <code>template.psd</code>.</p>\n<h4>Step 3: Define the Variables</h4>\n<p>In order to automatically create each collage, I needed to create a variable for each of the images. To do so go to Image &gt; Variables &gt; Define...</p>\n<p>In the dialog window, do the following</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the layer that has your first image in the Layer dropdown</li>\n<li>Check off Pixel Replacement, under Variable Type</li>\n<li>Enter a name for the variable</li>\n<li>Leave the method as Fit</li>\n<li>Repeat for each of the other image layers</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src="'+s(183)+'" alt=""></p>\n<h4>Step 4: Create the Data Sets</h4>\n<p>Now that the variables are defined, we need to create a CSV that tells photoshop which images to use for each variable. The CSV should be in the following format:</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code">&lt;var 1&gt;,&lt;var 2&gt;,&lt;var 3&gt;,&lt;var 4&gt;\n/path/to/image/1,/path/to/image/2,/path/to/image/3,/path/to/image/4\n</div></pre>\n<p>When we process the file, a new <code>psd</code> will be created for each row, with the images referenced for each variable.</p>\n<p>I wrote a quick Python script to loop over all the pictures and create a row for every batch of 4:</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> csv\n<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> os\n\nfile_path = <span class="hljs-string">\'/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports\'</span>\n\nrows = []\n\nnum = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>\nrow = []\n<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> file <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> os.listdir(file_path):\n    row.append(<span class="hljs-string">u\'{}/{}\'</span>.format(file_path, file))\n    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> len(row) == <span class="hljs-number">4</span>:\n        rows.append(row)\n        row = []\n        num += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>\n\nprint(rows)    \n\n<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> open(<span class="hljs-string">\'data_sets.csv\'</span>, mode=<span class="hljs-string">\'w\'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:\n    writer = csv.writer(f)\n    writer.writerow([<span class="hljs-string">\'img1\'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">\'img2\'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">\'img3\'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">\'img4\'</span>])\n    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> r <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> rows:\n        writer.writerow(r)\n</div></pre>\n<p>The output looked something like this:</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code">img1,img2,img3,img4\n/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/081.jpg,/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/082.jpg,/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/083.jpg,/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/084.jpg\n/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/085.jpg,/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/086.jpg,/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/087.jpg,/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/088.jpg\n/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/089.jpg,/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/090.jpg,/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/091.jpg,/Volumes/Storage/Photo Booth Exports/092.jpg\n...\n</div></pre>\n<h4>Step 5: Processing the Data Sets</h4>\n<p>Back in Photoshop, we need to import the Data Set file we created. To do so, select Image &gt; Variables &gt; Data Sets..., then choose Import in the dialog box. Select the csv you created, uncheck &quot;Use First Column For Data Set Names&quot; and hit OK, then OK again.</p>\n<p><img src="'+s(182)+'" alt=""></p>\n<p>To process the data sets, select File &gt; Export &gt; Data Sets as Files. Then, select an output directory and &quot;All Data Sets&quot;, and optionally modify the naming scheme below. When you are ready, click OK.</p>\n<p><img src="'+s(184)+'" alt=""></p>\n<p>Photoshop will run for a while, creating the PSD files for each row in the CSV. Once it is done you can open one or more of them up and verify it looks how you want.</p>\n<h4>Step 6: Exporting the Collages as JPEGs</h4>\n<p>You likely want to export the images for sharing. Luckily, there\'s an easy way to batch export PSDs to JPEGs (or any other format).</p>\n<p>In Photoshop, go to File &gt; Scripts &gt; Image Processor. First, choose the folder containing the PSDs from Step 5. Next, choose the folder to output the processed images to. Select the file type and options, then click Run.</p>\n<p><img src="'+s(185)+'" alt=""></p>\n<p>That\'s it! After the processing is complete, your output folder should contain JPEG versions of all of your collages.</p>\n<p>All in, this process probably took 2 hours. That\'s including transferring the pictures to my NAS, waiting for exports, and learning how to automate Photoshop like this. I would guess this could all be done in an hour if you have your Photoshop template done before hand.</p>\n</section>\n'},1077:function(t,e,s){t.exports='<section><p><img src="'+s(23)+'" alt=""></p>\n<p><sup><em>The finished product</em></sup></p>\n<p>I recently attended a 50th birthday party for my partner\'s Aunt and Uncle. When planning, the idea of a photo booth came up. &quot;I have a nice camera&quot;, I thought, deciding it shouldn\'t be too difficult to set up. I set out exploring different software options to help me with this. The criteria was as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tethers to cameras to allow an operator-free photo booth experience</li>\n<li>Takes 3-4 pictures at a time</li>\n<li>(optional) Accepts email addresses to send the pictures out</li>\n<li>(optional) Creates photo strips or collages of each session</li>\n<li>Is free or cheap</li>\n<li>Works with Sony cameras</li>\n<li>Runs on MacOS</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unfortunately, I couldn\'t find anything that met all my criteria. I did find some free or relatively cheap options, but they either didn\'t work with my Sony a6000 or required Windows to run. Most of them were just too expensive for my uses.</p>\n<p>Through this research, I discovered that my camera actually has <a href="https://developer.sony.com/file/download/sony-camera-remote-api-beta-sdk-2/">an API</a> you can interact with over the WiFi connection! So, with 3 days before the event, I put on my developer hat and set out to build my own solution. Without further ado, let\'s see what I did.</p>\n<h4>The Requirements</h4>\n<p>When I first started this project, the plan was to create a simple UI that shows a live view of the camera, has a button that starts a 3-second countdown, then takes 4 pictures with a second or 2 in between.</p>\n<p>After playing with the API and various libraries on different platforms, I realized it was too complex to support a live view of the camera. It is implemented as a streaming HTTP request that you need to parse in chunks to decode the image. While doable, it wasn\'t necessary so I decided to focus my efforts on taking and displaying the pictures.</p>\n<p>That leaves us with the following requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The app has a button to start the capture that users can press</li>\n<li>There is a 3 second countdown before taking any pictures</li>\n<li>4 pictures are taken with a short delay between each</li>\n<li>The photos are displayed in the screen after each session</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>The UI</h4>\n<p>To set this up quickly, I decided to make a quick Vue app. The app is dead simple, consisting of a single component that does everything.</p>\n<p>The template just contains a grid of pictures and a button to start the countdown</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"app"</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">v-if</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"!cam.connected"</span>&gt;</span>\n    Waiting for camera...\n  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">v-if</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"cam.connected"</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"pics"</span>&gt;</span>\n      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">img</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"pic"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">v-for</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"pic in pictures"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">:key</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"pic"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">:src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"pic"</span>/&gt;</span>\n    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"button-div"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">v-if</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"!active || countdown !== 0"</span>&gt;</span>\n      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">button</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"button"</span> @<span class="hljs-attr">click</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"startPics"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">:disabled</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"active"</span>&gt;</span>\n        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">span</span> <span class="hljs-attr">v-if</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"countdown === 0"</span>&gt;</span>📸<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">span</span>&gt;</span>\n        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">span</span> <span class="hljs-attr">v-if</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"countdown !== 0"</span>&gt;</span>{{ countdown }}<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">span</span>&gt;</span>\n      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">button</span>&gt;</span>\n    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>\n<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>\n</div></pre>\n<p><img src="'+s(186)+'" alt=""></p>\n<p>After about 10 seconds, the app resets and allows another set of pictures to be taken.</p>\n<p>The Javascript for this was pretty straightforward as well.

The only methods I needed for this was <code>connect()</code> and <code>capture()</code>. When the button is clicked and the countdown has elapsed, I recursively call <code>capture()</code> using <code>setTimeout()</code> to space out the images. The callback to <code>capture()</code> gets the URL of the image to display and appends it to a list of URLs, which the template binds to the <code>src</code> attribute of <code>img</code> elements.</p>\n<h4>The Server</h4>\n<p>You may have noticed that I am initializing the <code>sony-camera</code> library with an address of <code>localhost:3000</code>. The reason for this is that my requests to the camera were being blocked by CORS, as the camera doesn\'t set any <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header. So, I built a simple node.js proxy server to route my requests through.</p>\n<pre class="hljs"><div class="code"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> http = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">\'http\'</span>);\n\nhttp.createServer(onRequest).listen(<span class="hljs-number">3000</span>);\n\n<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">onRequest</span>(<span class="hljs-params">client_req, client_res</span>) </span>{\n  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">\'serve: \'</span> + client_req.url);\n\n  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> options = {\n    <span class="hljs-attr">hostname</span>: <span class="hljs-string">\'192.168.122.1\'</span>,\n    <span class="hljs-attr">port</span>: <span class="hljs-number">8080</span>,\n    <span class="hljs-attr">path</span>: client_req.url,\n    <span class="hljs-attr">method</span>: client_req.method,\n    <span class="hljs-attr">headers</span>: client_req.headers\n  };\n\n  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> proxy = http.request(options, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">res</span>) </span>{\n    res.headers[<span class="hljs-string">\'access-control-allow-origin\'</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">\'*\'</span>\n    client_res.writeHead(res.statusCode, res.headers)\n    res.pipe(client_res, {\n      <span class="hljs-attr">end</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>\n    }).on(<span class="hljs-string">\'error\'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log);\n  });\n\n  client_req.pipe(proxy, {\n    <span class="hljs-attr">end</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>\n  }).on(<span class="hljs-string">\'error\'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log);\n}\n</div></pre>\n<p>All of the code is <a href="https://gist.github.com/evansalter/694487c86f6c6d79892e418840ad6c9a">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Putting it all Together</h4>\n<p>At the party, we set up a backdrop using table cloths and other decorations. We picked up some novelty glasses that people can wear for the pictures, and left a notepad for people to write down their email addresses on.</p>\n<p>In front of the backdrop, I set up a small table with a tripod and my laptop. I set up my camera on the tripod with a speedlight attached, switched to manual mode and played with the settings until it looked right (I cheaped out on the speedlights, so they don\'t have TTL metering that works with my Sony camera. This requires some trial-and-error). I also brought my battery charger with 2 extra camera batteries, since the Sony a6000 doesn\'t allow you to charge via USB while using the camera.</p>\n<p>Finally, I turned on the computer, enabled <a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a> so the screensaver wouldn\'t start, and connected the camera:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Turn on the camera</li>\n<li>Start the Smart Remote Control app on the camera</li>\n<li>Connect the computer to the Camera\'s WiFi network</li>\n<li>Start the proxy server</li>\n<li>Start the app server</li>\n<li>Open the browser to the app</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And that\'s it! The program ran smoothly for the majority of the night. The camera battery died once, so I just swapped that out and re-connected. I also discovered the speedlight turns off automatically after not firing for some time, so I ended up with a couple batches of dark pictures.</p>\n<h4>Other Specs</h4>\n<p><strong>Camera</strong>: Sony a6000<br>\n<strong>Lens</strong>: Sony E 18-105 f/4 G<br>\n<strong>Focal Length</strong>: 20mm<br>\n<strong>Aperature</strong>: f/7.1<br>\n<strong>Shutter Speed</strong>: 1/100 s<br>\n<strong>ISO</strong> 640</p>\n<p>Ideally, I would have shot with my FE 50mm, but I just didn\'t have enough space for that. I chose a ~f/7 aperature to ensure I got everybody in focus, and I tried to keep the speedlight power low to avoid the photo booth being too distracting for the rest of the guests.</p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>I was extremely happy with the result of this project. Being able to use what I already had to pull this off felt great. The photo booth got lots of use, with 232 photos being taken throughout the night. People had a lot of fun with it, and it gave the hosts some great mementos from the night. Had I given myself some more time, I probably could have made a more robust app, but it really wasn\'t necessary.</p>\n<p>Check out Part 2, <a href="/blog/processing-232-photo-booth-photos">Processing
